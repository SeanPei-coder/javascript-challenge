## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... the collection is too large to search through manually. Even the most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

That's why I am hired. I can write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided. I can also allow our users to filter the table data for specific values.

## Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

- search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

## Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

- multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

1. date/time
2. city
3. state
4. country
5. shape
